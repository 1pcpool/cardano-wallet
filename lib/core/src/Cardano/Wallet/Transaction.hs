        -- seemingly coupled to the binary representation of a 'Transaction'.
        -- This estimation is therefore only a best-effort here as many of the
        -- encoding values actually depends on the value of parameters at
        -- runtime.

        -- For instance, with a CBOR encoding, an amount of `50` lovelace would
        -- be encoded using 2 bytes, whereas an amount of `1000000` would be
        -- encoded using 4 bytes. In Byron, we have only one piece of unknown
        -- from the 'CoinSelection' and it's the value of the 'crc32' computed
        -- on the address payload, which can be 1,2,3 or 5 bytes and we therefore
        -- always consider the worst-case scenario of a 5-byte crc.
        -- As a consequence, our estimate may be slightly bigger than the actual
        -- transaction fee (up-to 4 extra bytes per change output).
