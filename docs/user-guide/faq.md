{{<expand "I‚Äôve noticed that other blockchains create accounts for wallets?" "...">}}

There are two sides to this question. Either, you are referring to accounts as in Ethereum accounts, or you may refer to accounts of hierarchical deterministic wallets.

In the first scenario, assets in the form of accounts are only supported in the Shelley era of Cardano and only for a specific use-case: rewards. Rewards are indeed implicitely published on the blockchain to mitigate the risk of flooding the network at the end of every epoch with rewards payouts! Hence, each core node keeps track of the current value of each reward account in a Ledger. Money can be withdrawn from this account and is then turned as a UTxO. Funds can never be manually sent to a reward account however. The creation of a reward account is done when registering a staking key, via a specific type of transaction.

In the second case, refer to the [HD wallets](docs/key-concepts/hierarchical-deterministic-wallets) section in the _Key concepts_. Cardano wallets typically follow an HD tree of derivation as described in this section.

üê≥ [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is your friend here! Every component is packaged as docker images. Releases are tagged and the very edge is always accessible. See the various docker guides on the components' repository, and also how to compose services using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

{{<expand "Is there a reason why I would have to build from src?" "...">}}

If you intend to contribute to Cardano by making code changes to one of the core components, then yes. We recommend using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) for a better developer experience. 

If you only intend to use the services as-is then, using either the pre-compiled release artifacts on your appropriate platform or, a pre-packaged docker image would be preferable.

- On Byron, have a look at: https://testnets.cardano.org/en/cardano/byron/tools/faucet
- On Shelley, this is coming soon.
