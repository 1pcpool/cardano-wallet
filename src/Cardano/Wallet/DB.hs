-- | A Database interface for storing various things in a DB. In practice,
-- we'll need some extra contraints on the wallet state that allows us to
-- serialize and unserialize it (e.g. @forall s. (Serialize s) => ...@)
data DBLayer m s = DBLayer
    -- Wallet checkpoints, checkpoints are handled as a bounded FIFO, where we
    -- eventually store @k@ values (e.g. k=2160) at the same time.

-- | A primary key which can take many forms depending on the value. This may
-- become a type family as we move forward, but for now, it illustrate that
-- some queries are ran against some sort of store;
--
-- As a matter of fact, we may manipulate multiple wallets at the same time, so,
-- functions like 'enqueueCheckpoint' needs to be associated to a corresponding
-- wallet. Some other may not because they are information valid for all wallets
-- (like for instance, the last known network tip).
