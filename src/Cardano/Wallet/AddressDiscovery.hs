-- scheme as specified in BIP-0044. Later, we may introduce backward

                          Sequential Derivation

    Discovery of addresses in the sequential derivation as specified by BIP-44.
    The management of _accounts_ is left-out for this implementation focuses on
    a single account. In practice, one wants to manage a set of pools, one per
    account.
